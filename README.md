# combotools
A collection of tools to work on username:password combo lists

Many of the tools listed here were taken from CompilationOfManyBreaches (COMB) project and further adapted and developed on, credits go to the rightfull owners whoever they may be.

I like the simplicity of them, they are easy to read, understand and rely solely on the highly efficient linux standard binaries.

To use this on mac I recommend using homebrew and doing:
   ```
   brew install coreutils
   ```

Use this only for threat analysis and educational purposes, please.
